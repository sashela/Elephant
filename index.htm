        <h2>"Raj: Symbol of Triumph"</h2>
        <p>Meet Raj, the resilient elephant who defied all odds after surviving a poacher attack that left him badly wounded. Thanks to the dedicated care at our facility, Raj made a remarkable recovery, embodying the strength and spirit of our conservation efforts. Today, he thrives in a safe environment, enjoying a life filled with joy and curiosity. One of his endearing quirks is his fondness for adorning his head with leaves, a playful reminder of his indomitable nature and the hope he represents for all elephants under our care. Raj's journey is a testament to the impact of our work and the resilience of these magnificent creatures.</p>

        <h2 id="dot">Elephant Brothers: "Unbreakable Bond"</h2>
        <p>Meet Kavi and Arun, the two brave elephant brothers who found themselves lost and injured, far from their herd. When they were brought into our care, we witnessed something truly special â€“ a bond between them that transcended words. Through dedicated treatment and nurturing, Kavi and Arun not only recovered from their injuries but also grew closer, leaning on each other for support and companionship. As they regained their strength, it became evident that their bond was the key to their resilience. Eventually, the day came when they were ready to return to the wild, reunited with their herd, stronger together than ever before. Their story is a testament to the power of brotherhood and the unwavering spirit of elephants in the face of adversity.</p>
